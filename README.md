The below is a link to the mindDump (a to-do list management tool) spreadsheet on Google Drive: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfW_cp1gsgbELwJIBBmDUGQvKhly68gyPE2FZyzxOWg/copy

If you hit the "Copy" button that appears when you follow the above link, a copy of the spreadsheet will appear on the "My Drive" folder (at the top of the folder hierarchy) in your Google Drive. That copy, which will include the attached script that makes mindDump work, is yours to use for building your personal reference library. Ideally, you would move the file down into a folder designated for your project management activities. 

mindDump is a project management tool (a Google sheet) that lists all the action items or follow-up activities from a meeting, with due dates (when assigned), and filed under different categories for optimal organization.  This to-do list will copy the items into your Google Tasks under the same categories, if desired.

When you try to press either the help button or the calendar icon button that syncs the list with your Google Tasks, for the first time, you will instead be greeted with an alert that informs you that you need to authorize the script to write into your Google Tasks. Specifically, you will see the following, and should take the indicated action: 

"Authorization Required" --> click on the GREEN "Continue" 
"Choose an account" --> select the Google Account / email that you wish to use by clicking on it.
"Google hasn't verified this app":  
    --> scroll to the bottom and click on the small grey underlined "Advanced" in lower left corner.
    --> scroll down to bottom and click on small grey underlined "Go to mindDump (unsafe)" at the very bottom.
"mindDump wants to access your Google Account" --> scroll to the bottom and click the "Allow" button.

After the above steps, you will be able to run the scripts.

Feel free to contact me if you run into permission problems or if you notice any bugs as you use the code.
